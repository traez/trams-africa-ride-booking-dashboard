  The handleInputChange function is designed to process changes in the input fields for both pickup and destination locations. It takes two parameters: the event triggered by the input change, and the locationType, which specifies whether the change pertains to the pickup or destination field. Within the function, the input value is extracted from the event using destructuring. This value is then used to update the locations state by merging the current state with the new value corresponding to the active input field (either pickup or destination). The activeInput state is also updated to indicate which input field is currently being edited, facilitating the display of relevant suggestions.

Before proceeding to fetch place predictions, the function checks if the Google Maps API has been loaded by verifying the existence of the window.google object. If the API is available, a new instance of AutocompleteService is created to interact with the Google Maps Places API. When the user types a value into the input field, the function calls getPlacePredictions to retrieve location predictions based on the current input. If the API call is successful and returns predictions, the suggestions state is updated with these predictions, specifically extracting the descriptions of each predicted place. In cases where the input field is empty, the function clears any existing suggestions for the corresponding input field, ensuring that users only see relevant options.

After updating the input, the function clears the suggestions for both pickup and destination to prevent any visual clutter in the dropdown. Finally, it resets the activeInput state to null, indicating that no input field is currently active or selected, enhancing user experience by providing a clean interface.

/* 
The return statement of the component renders a user interface for entering pickup and destination locations, leveraging the Google Maps Places Autocomplete functionality. It begins by creating a flexbox container that centers its content and provides a margin at the top. Inside this container, there is a maximum width defined for the input section, ensuring a clean layout with adequate spacing between elements.

The UI consists of two input fields, one for the pickup location and another for the destination. Each input field is accompanied by a label for clarity, enhancing the overall user experience. As the user types into the pickup or destination input, the corresponding suggestions appear in a dropdown menu, which is conditionally rendered based on whether there are any suggestions available and if the respective input field is active. Each suggestion is styled to provide a visual cue on hover, allowing users to easily select a suggestion by clicking it, which subsequently updates the input field with their choice.
